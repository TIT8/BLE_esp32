## Application

Implementation of a GATT client on [esp32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32#:~:text=ESP32%20is%20highly%2Dintegrated%20with,Hybrid%20Wi%2DFi%20%26%20Bluetooth%20Chip) using the BLE library of the ESP-IDF SDK.
I followed the [walkthrough](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/ble/gatt_client/tutorial/Gatt_Client_Example_Walkthrough.md) given by Espressif. Thanks to the developers of ESP-IDF examples and documentation, it's quite easy to start and practice üòç.

The code here is intended to create a BLE client that connects to the [BLE server](https://github.com/TIT8/BLE-sensor_PDM-microphone) provided by the Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense, which notifies for humidity changes from the HTS sensor.  
So the UUIDs provided are for a general Environmental Sensing Service (see [here](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/HTML/Assigned_Numbers/out/en/Assigned_Numbers.pdf?v=1713791642302) for more). Check the esp32 [configurations](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/ble/gatt_client/sdkconfig.defaults) when compiling via CMAKE (already handled by PlatformIO).

You have to connect the esp32 to the serial in order to see the received data (obviously), but also to connect to Bluetooth (it won't work in the background; it wasn't intended).
